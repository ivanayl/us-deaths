An [article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/13/us/deaths-covid-other-causes.html) by the New York Times detailed how COVID-19 was the leading cause of death in 2020, but other causes of death also witnessed significant increases in mortality. This inspired us to investigate what the leading factors of death might be in a pre-pandemic period and analyze if there were patterns already indicating the eventual rise in mortality. Another New York Times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/health/coronavirus-black-hispanic.html) examined which demographic factors were most affected by COVID-19 and found that socioeconomic, not necessarily racial, factors were most influential in determining exposure. This led us to hypothesize that socioeconomic and environmental factors may also be able to predict certain leading causes of death in a pre-pandemic period and enable policymakers to better tailor policy to reduce overall mortality tolls. \n","\n","The COVID-19 pandemic has been the foremost concern for about a year now, and the world is already all too familiar with the ways it has affected daily life. Every day, we live taking measures to stop the spread of the virus and we have seen how mortality has destroyed our labor forces, cost local government resources, and introduced unimaginable grief across the country. However, even though COVID-19 is currently the leading cause of death in the US, there is still a lot to be done to decrease the prevalence of other causes of death, which have seen rises in mortality in the past year. In light of how research has been poured into stopping the spread of COVID-19, we thought it would be interesting to learn more about other causes of death to see what the leading causes of death were over the past decade and analyze trends to determine what preventative measures can be taken to help decrease their mortality rates."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1oCjR833r-5H"},"source":["## Questions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PlTeIDFWr-5H"},"source":[" - Which causes of death are most prevalent?

The dataset includes data from 2005 to 2015, where each year’s data is stored in a separate file and table. Each file has 77 columns, although some discuss the same metric but measured differently. Additionally, each file has 2452506, 2430725, 2428343, 2476811, 2441219, 2472542, 2519842, 2547864, 2601452, 2631171, and 2718198 rows respectively. Given that each variable forms a column and each observation forms a row, we can see that the data is tidy, but there are missing values and nonsensical values that need to be edited into an analyzable format before we can fully work with it. We will not retain all of the 77 columns due to the fact that a significant number are not pertinent to the problem we are trying to analyze. We will focus on variables like sex, race, education, and age to find correlations between demographic factors and certain causes of death. The data also has categorical variables that have already been mapped to numeric values. We will need to convert them back to strings representing their respective categories so that our visualizations are more readable. Given that we found this dataset on Kaggle, we can see that there have been other projects that use this dataset, examining topics like men vs women in terms of mortality and so on. However, with this project, we seek to provide a broader idea of how socioeconomic factors correlate with particular causes of death, how they have changed over time, and what insights they can provide on violent deaths."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"V97xCMf0r-5K"},"source":["## Loading and Cleaning Data"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6J8z5pBHr-5K"},"source":["import pandas as pd"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1Rcil__z5Rdd"},"source":["We have already cleaned our data in a separate Jupyter notebook and saved it to clean.csv.

We can also see, as lines, the proportion of total deaths that each hispanic origin makes up as a means of comparing the death ratios to a baseline population proportion. We observe that none of the top 10 leading causes of death have a hispanic origin with a significantly different death ratio from the proportion of deaths that hispanic origin makes up.

We can also see, as lines, the proportion of total deaths that each hispanic origin category makes up as a means of comparing the death ratios to a baseline population proportion. We observe that Mexicans die from congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities and tuberculosis roughly 15% more than expected. The graph also tells us that Puerto Ricans are particularly vulnerable to HIV given that the ratio of deaths is roughly .31 and the ratio of total deaths that Puerto Ricans make up is about .11, a roughly .2 difference. It's interesting to note that while HIV kills more Puerto Ricans than expected, it also kills less Mexicans than expected and vice versa for congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities and tuberculosis."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jDaR_vNuFEMj"},"source":["#### Resident Status"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TZXZZmSFlqy0"},"source":["Again, we follow the same procedure as above."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"y4HFpBGpFHEd"},"source":["res_counts = df.groupby(['39_cause_recode',\n","                         'resident_status']).agg({'39_cause_recode': 'count'})\n","res_counts['ratio'] = res_counts.groupby(level=0).apply(lambda x: x / float(x.sum()))\n","res_counts = res_counts.drop(columns='39_cause_recode').reset_index()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SVe1uy8flqy0"},"source":["all_res = list(df.groupby('resident_status').size().index)\n","full_res_counts = create_full_df(all_causes, 'resident_status',\n","                                 all_res, res_counts)\n","\n","data = df.loc[df['resident_status'].notnull()]\n","res_props = df.groupby(['resident_status']).size().to_frame('count')\n","res_props = res_props.reset_index()\n","res_props['ratio'] = res_props['count']/len(data)\n","res_join = pd.merge(\n","    full_res_counts,\n","    res_props,\n","    how=\"inner\",\n","    on=\"resident_status\")\n","top_res_causes = res_join.loc[res_join['39_cause_recode'].isin(causes)]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gCQNoCsXFJD4","outputId":"33743b37-db27-4839-dbf3-d95b11cc3723"},"source":["title = \"The 10 Leading Causes of Death Don't Differ In Mortality between Different Resident Statuses\"\n","\n","bars = alt.Chart().mark_bar().encode(\n","    x=alt.X('resident_status:N',\n","            axis=alt.Axis(title=\"\", labels=False,ticks=False)),\n","    y=alt.Y('ratio_x:Q', axis=alt.Axis(title=\"Ratio\")),\n","    color='resident_status:N'\n",")\n","\n","line = alt.Chart().mark_rule(fill=\"black\").encode(\n","    x='resident_status:N',\n","    y='ratio_y:Q'\n",")\n","\n","ticks = alt.Chart().mark_tick(fill=\"black\", thickness=2).encode(\n","    x='resident_status:N',\n","    y='ratio_y:Q'\n",")\n","\n","alt.layer(bars, line, ticks, data=top_res_causes).facet(\n","    facet=alt.Facet('39_cause_recode:N', \n","                    header=alt.Header(title=\"Cause of Death\", \n","                                        titleOrient=\"bottom\",\n","                                        labelOrient=\"bottom\")),\n","    columns=5,\n","    title=title\n",").configure(\n","    lineBreak=\"\\n\"\n",").configure_axis(\n","    domain=False\n",")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["\n","<div id=\"altair-viz-50c06a837f0e4f1890f083bab68c1c71\"></div>\n","<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n","  (function(spec, embedOpt){\n","    let outputDiv = document.currentScript.previousElementSibling;\n","    if (outputDiv.id !== \"altair-viz-50c06a837f0e4f1890f083bab68c1c71\") {\n","      outputDiv = document.getElementById(\"altair-viz-50c06a837f0e4f1890f083bab68c1c71\");\n","    }\n","    const paths = {\n","      \"vega\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega@5?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lib\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lib?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lite\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lite@4.8.1?noext\",\n","      \"vega-embed\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-embed@6?noext\",\n","    };\n","\n","    function loadScript(lib) {\n","      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n","        var s = document.createElement('script');\n","        s.src = paths[lib];\n","        s.async = true;\n","        s.onload = () => resolve(paths[lib]);\n","        s.onerror = () => reject(`Error loading script: ${paths[lib]}`);\n","        document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(s);\n","      });\n","    }\n","\n","    function showError(err) {\n","      outputDiv.innerHTML = `<div class=\"error\" style=\"color:red;\">${err}</div>`;\n","      throw err;\n","    }\n","\n","    function displayChart(vegaEmbed) {\n","      vegaEmbed(outputDiv, spec, embedOpt)\n","        .catch(err => showError(`Javascript Error: ${err.message}<br>This usually means there's a typo in your chart specification.

causes of death in the US from 2005 to 2015. We can also see, as lines, the proportion of total deaths that each age category makes up as a means of comparing the death ratios to a baseline population proportion. We observe that people aged 85 or older die from Alzheimer's roughly 35% more than expected and from influenza and pneumonia as well as other/miscellaneous diseases of the heart about 15% more than expected. The graph also tells us that for lung and tracheal cancer as well as other cancers, people aged 85 or older died less than expected, with the differences being around .17 and .13 respectively. The other leading causes of deaths always have differences below .1, so the other top 10 leading causes of death do not significantly affect one age category more than another (we consider .15 to be significant)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ixeoVHgClqy2"},"source":["age_join['diff'] = age_join['ratio_x'] - age_join['ratio_y']\n","top_age = age_join.loc[abs(age_join['diff']) > .15]\n","top_age = list(set(top_age['39_cause_recode']))\n","top_age_diff = age_join.loc[age_join['39_cause_recode'].isin(top_age)]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DnURU_jslqy3","outputId":"a37ad316-3260-4262-c381-f2bbba3ea0b8"},"source":["bars = alt.Chart().mark_bar().encode(\n","    x=alt.X('age_recode_12:N',\n","            axis=alt.Axis(title=\"\", labels=False,ticks=False)),\n","    y=alt.Y('ratio_x:Q', axis=alt.Axis(title=\"Ratio\")),\n","    color='age_recode_12:N'\n",")\n","\n","line = alt.Chart().mark_rule(fill=\"black\").encode(\n","    x='age_recode_12:N',\n","    y='ratio_y:Q'\n",")\n","\n","ticks = alt.Chart().mark_tick(fill=\"black\", thickness=2).encode(\n","    x='age_recode_12:N',\n","    y='ratio_y:Q'\n",")\n","\n","alt.layer(bars, line, ticks, data=top_age_diff).facet(\n","    facet=alt.Facet('39_cause_recode:N', \n","                    header=alt.Header(title=\"Cause of Death\", \n","                                        titleOrient=\"bottom\",\n","                                        labelOrient=\"bottom\")),\n","    columns=4,\n","    spacing=-25,\n","    title=\"Different Age Categories Have Different Mortality Rates for Causes of Death Like Assault/Homicide\"\n",").configure(\n","    lineBreak=\"\\n\"\n",").configure_axis(\n","    domain=False\n",")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["\n","<div id=\"altair-viz-8ce66321706b43468aa9a7c58537f880\"></div>\n","<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n","  (function(spec, embedOpt){\n","    let outputDiv = document.currentScript.previousElementSibling;\n","    if (outputDiv.id !== \"altair-viz-8ce66321706b43468aa9a7c58537f880\") {\n","      outputDiv = document.getElementById(\"altair-viz-8ce66321706b43468aa9a7c58537f880\");\n","    }\n","    const paths = {\n","      \"vega\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega@5?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lib\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lib?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lite\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lite@4.8.1?noext\",\n","      \"vega-embed\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-embed@6?noext\",\n","    };\n","\n","    function loadScript(lib) {\n","      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n","        var s = document.createElement('script');\n","        s.src = paths[lib];\n","        s.async = true;\n","        s.onload = () => resolve(paths[lib]);\n","        s.onerror = () => reject(`Error loading script: ${paths[lib]}`);\n","        document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(s);\n","      });\n","    }\n","\n","    function showError(err) {\n","      outputDiv.innerHTML = `<div class=\"error\" style=\"color:red;\">${err}</div>`;\n","      throw err;\n","    }\n","\n","    function displayChart(vegaEmbed) {\n","      vegaEmbed(outputDiv, spec, embedOpt)\n","        .catch(err => showError(`Javascript Error: ${err.message}<br>This usually means there's a typo in your chart specification.

illustrates, as bars, the ratio of the number of deaths for a particular age demographic and cause of death to the total number of deaths for that cause of death. We can also see, as lines, the proportion of total deaths that each age category makes up as a means of comparing the death ratios to a baseline population proportion. We observe that people aged 85 or older die from Alzheimer's roughly 35% more than expected, from hypertension related diseases about 15% more than expected, and from influenza and pneumonia as well as other/miscellaneous diseases of the heart about 15% more than expected. The chart also demonstrates that assault/homicide deaths among 15-24 year olds and 25-34 year olds were roughly 25% higher than expected. We also see that certain conditions originating in the perinatal period, congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities, and sudden infant death syndrome overwhelmingly have more deaths for people under 1 year old than any other age demographic, which makes sense since these causes of deaths are commonly ones that babies or children suffer from. Additionally, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis appears to kill more people in the 45-64 year old age range than expected compared to the other age categories. Intentional self harm and suicide also affects people younger than 54 more than expected, indicating young people are potentially more likely to commit suicide. People in the age range of 15-44 years old also die more from motor vehicle accidents than expected as well as pregnancy/childbirth related causes."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Rfs0ZoxoF4d-"},"source":["#### Marital Status"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"U5rzv65XF-ph"},"source":["marital_counts = df.groupby(['39_cause_recode',\n","                             'marital_status']).agg({'39_cause_recode':\n","                                                     'count'})\n","marital_counts['ratio'] = marital_counts.groupby(level=0).apply(lambda x: x / float(x.sum()))\n","marital_counts = marital_counts.drop(columns='39_cause_recode').reset_index()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0g0PPdYDlqy3"},"source":["all_marital = list(df.groupby('marital_status').size().index)\n","full_marital_counts = create_full_df(all_causes, 'marital_status',\n","                                 all_marital, marital_counts)\n","\n","data = df.loc[df['marital_status'].notnull()]\n","marital_props = df.groupby(['marital_status']).size().to_frame('count')\n","marital_props = marital_props.reset_index()\n","marital_props['ratio'] = marital_props['count']/len(data)\n","marital_join = pd.merge(\n","    full_marital_counts,\n","    marital_props,\n","    how=\"inner\",\n","    on=\"marital_status\")\n","top_marital_causes = marital_join.loc[marital_join['39_cause_recode'].isin(causes)]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"r8XyL5nzGAee","outputId":"623a535f-8af1-47e3-ecc9-093b48d4da22"},"source":["title = \"Most of the 10 Leading Causes of Death Don't Differ In Mortality between Different Marital Statuses\"\n","\n","bars = alt.Chart().mark_bar().encode(\n","    x=alt.X('marital_status:N',\n","            axis=alt.Axis(title=\"\", labels=False,ticks=False)),\n","    y=alt.Y('ratio_x:Q', axis=alt.Axis(title=\"Ratio\")),\n","    color='marital_status:N'\n",")\n","\n","line = alt.Chart().mark_rule(fill=\"black\").encode(\n","    x='marital_status:N',\n","    y='ratio_y:Q'\n",")\n","\n","ticks = alt.Chart().mark_tick(fill=\"black\", thickness=2).encode(\n","    x='marital_status:N',\n","    y='ratio_y:Q'\n",")\n","\n","alt.layer(bars, line, ticks, data=top_marital_causes).facet(\n","    facet=alt.Facet('39_cause_recode:N', \n","                    header=alt.Header(title=\"Cause of Death\", \n","                                        titleOrient=\"bottom\",\n","                                        labelOrient=\"bottom\")),\n","    columns=5,\n","    title=title\n",").configure(\n","    lineBreak=\"\\n\"\n",").configure_axis(\n","    domain=False\n",")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["\n","<div id=\"altair-viz-3fbfedb0125c4c3b8d07fd362d5cbd4e\"></div>\n","<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n","  (function(spec, embedOpt){\n","    let outputDiv = document.currentScript.previousElementSibling;\n","    if (outputDiv.id !== \"altair-viz-3fbfedb0125c4c3b8d07fd362d5cbd4e\") {\n","      outputDiv = document.getElementById(\"altair-viz-3fbfedb0125c4c3b8d07fd362d5cbd4e\");\n","    }\n","    const paths = {\n","      \"vega\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega@5?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lib\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lib?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lite\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lite@4.8.1?noext\",\n","      \"vega-embed\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-embed@6?noext\",\n","    };\n","\n","    function loadScript(lib) {\n","      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n","        var s = document.createElement('script');\n","        s.src = paths[lib];\n","        s.async = true;\n","        s.onload = () => resolve(paths[lib]);\n","        s.onerror = () => reject(`Error loading script: ${paths[lib]}`);\n","        document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(s);\n","      });\n","    }\n","\n","    function showError(err) {\n","      outputDiv.innerHTML = `<div class=\"error\" style=\"color:red;\">${err}</div>`;\n","      throw err;\n","    }\n","\n","    function displayChart(vegaEmbed) {\n","      vegaEmbed(outputDiv, spec, embedOpt)\n","        .catch(err => showError(`Javascript Error: ${err.message}<br>This usually means there's a typo in your chart specification.

illustrates, as bars, the ratio of the number of deaths for a particular marital status and cause of death to the total number of deaths for that cause of death, examining only the top 10 leading

We can also see, as lines, the proportion of total deaths that each marital status makes up as a means of comparing the death ratios to a baseline population proportion. The graph above shows us that all but Alzheimer's disease from the top 10 leading causes of death have roughly equal mortality rates between the different marital statuses. We can see that Alzheimer's kills significantly more widowed people than expected (nearly 25% more than expected), while it also kills less divorced, married, and never married/single people than expected by at least 5%.

illustrates, as bars, the ratio of the number of deaths for a particular marital status and cause of death to the total number of deaths for that cause of death, examining only the top 10 leading causes of death in the US from 2005 to 2015. We can also see, as lines, the proportion of total deaths that each marital status makes up as a means of comparing the death ratios to a baseline population proportion. It's notable that Alzheimer's and Atherosclerosis had roughly 25% and 20% respectively more widow deaths than expected and significantly more (about 45% more) never married/single people died of assault/homicide than expected. Additionally, single people die from certain conditions originating in the perinatal period, congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities, and sudden infant death syndrome than expected, which makes sense since those deaths are usually babies or children and such people are nearly always unmarried/single. Moreover, the graph shows us that HIV, intentional self harm, motor vehicle accidents, and pregnancy/childbirth related deaths also kill more single/never married people than expected, all with a difference of at least .15. The chart also details that more divorced people die from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis than expected by roughly 15% and that married people (presumably men) die from prostate cancer about 20%

It was surprising to see that Koreans stood out the most across most education levels, but overall, the trend remained consistent in that most races have difference rates of suicide across education levels.\n","\n","Another particularly striking point was how high the rate of suicide was among Koreans at varying levels of college education, which also might give an indication about the culture behind education in Korea being very stressful and not providing much hope beyond college."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FZuszvDZmXYH"},"source":["Overall, it was surprising that race and education didn’t have as much of a correlation as initially expected, but looking more closely reveals trends that are undeniable relating race, education, and suicide.

We observed that men are more vulnerable to causes of death like assault/homicide and motor vehicles accidents than women. Additionally, the data tells us that black people are by far more vulnerable to causes of death like HIV and syphilis than their counterparts, which indicates that policymakers need to focus on increasing the access and affordability of healthcare as well as quality of care for the black community. High rates of tuberculosis death for Mexicans can also be explained by the high tuberculosis incidence rate at the US-Mexico border, which is higher than the national average. Our study indicates that this is a major problem since the actual ratio of deaths by far exceeded the expected ratio of deaths and as such, policymakers need to address this healthcare crisis in addition to the other problems the government faces at the border.\n","\n","We also observed how factors like age, race, sex, and education might have different relations to suicide. The main idea was how different cultures might have different stigmas regarding mental health and suicide, and how it might affect age groups differently. For example, young people tend to be more prone to suicide, but older people also account for a majority of suicides. American Indians tend to have the highest rate of suicide overall, while Black Americans tend to have the lowest, indicating a cultural difference between how to approach mental health issues, or what types of mental health issues that these demographics experience. Males tend to commit suicide more than females, which points to how cultural factors might encourage men and women to approach mental health differently. All of this supports the idea that there are cultural factors that play into how people view their own mental health and thoughts of suicide. Each individual being more aware of what they may be more prone to could help with people seeking the help they need, and policymakers can support making resources more widely available not only for help but also to help raise awareness of issues that might lead to suicide for different demographic groups.\n","\n","Overall, we observed that the mortality rates of the top 10 leading causes of death have increased from 2005 to 2015, and according to articles from sources like the NY Times, this trend is still happening in 2020. This study supports the conclusion that this trend is not exclusive to 2020 and in fact has been a long-standing issue. In order to reverse such a trend, policymakers need to address the demographics most affected by particular causes of death. Further research could be conducted for additional demographic breakdowns not examined in the study like location in the US since different healthcare policy, access, and quality is sure to impact mortality rates. \n"]}]}
